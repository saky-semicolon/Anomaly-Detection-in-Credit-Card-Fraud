# Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Fraud: A Comparative Analysis of

# Autoencoder, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM

**Abstract**
Credit card fraud detection is an important research problem but is considered to be a difficult problem due to the
nature of the transaction data where the number of fraudulent transactions is small compared to normal transactions.
This project implements an anomaly detection system through the use of an autoencoder which is a kind of deep
learning model with unsupervised learning. The idea of the model is to discover those transactions that normally are
not like the rest as they may possibly be fraudulent. To compare the results, two other transfer learning models are
used alongside the proposed autoencoder: Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM. The data is taken from Kaggle and
the data covers 284806 transactions with 30 features obtained by applying PCA. The preprocessing part included
scaling of the data and applying feature reduction to 15 features. The normal transaction data was used to train the
autoencoder and performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall and ROC AUC value. The results best ROC
AUC of 0.94 for the autoencoder ensures the models effectiveness for fraud detection over the transfer learning
models. This work illustrates the applicability of deep learning in the real-world financial abnormalities and
performs the comparative analysis of classical and deep learning-based approaches.
**I. INTRODUCTION**
Digital payment systems adoption resulted in a sharp
growth of credit card transaction volumes. The fast-growing
digital payment systems have triggered a massive increase in
fraudulent transactions which presents difficult obstacles to
financial institutions worldwide. Online payment systems
face weakened consumer trust due to credit card fraud which
brings about considerable financial losses. Detecting
fraudulent transactions remains a challenging task due to the
highly imbalanced nature of the datasets, where fraudulent
transactions account for a tiny fraction of the total, as well as
the dynamic and evolving nature of fraud patterns. Strong
and flexible fraud detection systems need to be developed
with adaptability to emerging fraud patterns because of these
technical obstacles.
The detection of abnormal patterns in credit card
transactions has become an efficient solution for detecting
fraudulent activities because of anomaly detection methods.
Supervised learning models need labeled fraudulent and
non-fraudulent transaction data while anomaly detection
methods use legitimate data patterns to detect outlier
transactions which they label as potential frauds. The
method performs well under conditions where the available
fraudulent data is either sparse or hard to label.
Autoencoders represent a preferred deep learning-based
anomaly detection approach because they effectively detect
normal and anomalous patterns while capturing complex
models in high-dimensional data [1], [2].
Various studies show that autoencoders can efficiently
detect financial frauds within data sets. The research from
Najmi Rosley et al. [1] proposed deep autoencoders for
credit card fraud detection through reconstruction error as
their detection metric. Similarly, Priyanka Sharma et al. [2]
compared autoencoders against neural networks and
demonstrated that autoencoders provide better results for
detecting fraud patterns. According to Nguyen et al. [3] deep
learning solutions that include autoencoders prove superior
to conventional machine learning approaches like logistic
regression and decision trees for fraud detection tasks. The
research findings demonstrate how autoencoders represent a
strong technique for detecting anomalies.
The simplicity and efficiency of Isolation Forest and
One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) make them
standard choices for fraud detection tasks which operate
through unsupervised learning methods. Gayatri Ketepalli et
al. [4] and Shan Jiang et al. [5] conducted performance
analyses of traditional models including their capacity
limitations during fraud detection processes involving
complex high-dimensional datasets. Hosein Fanai et al. [6]
built a hybrid system which unites deep autoencoders with
traditional classifiers to achieve superior fraud detection
accuracy. These classic models excel in computational
efficiency yet fall short when it comes to adjusting to
changing fraud patterns that occur swiftly [7] and [8].
The research went through an evaluation between deep
learning autoencoders and conventional methods like
Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM for detecting
anomalies in credit card transactions. A total of 284,
transactions from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
which contains only 492 cases of fraud while maintaining
this ratio of distribution imbalance. The study uses key
metrics like ROC-AUC and precision and recall to assess
the effectiveness of these models after a large number of
experiments and performance evaluations. The study
demonstrates both positive and negative points of these
methods using experimental results to show how deep
learning approaches excel over standard fraud detection
methods.
**II. LITERATURE REVIEW**
The detection of anomalies serves as the fundamental
approach in combating credit card fraud through various
developed techniques. Multiple analytical methods from
classical machine learning models and contemporary deep
learning structures have developed stronger capabilities for
detecting financial transaction fraud.
The detection of credit card transaction anomalies has
commonly used two traditional machine learning
algorithms: Isolation Forest alongside Support Vector
Machines (SVM). Swati Gupta et al. [9] conducted a study


on the behavior of Isolation Forest for fraud identification
and identified its computational speed but reported its
weaknesses when applied to unbalanced data distributions.
Yogendra et al. [10] joined traditional machine learning
algorithms with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
features extraction and classification purposes which
boosted detection performance.
Modern deep learning models overcome traditional
techniques because they effectively process complex
high-dimensional datasets. J. Chen [11] introduced a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network model which delivered
higher accuracy and recall results than conventional
machine learning solutions. A systematic review performed
by Cherif et al. [12] proved that deep learning methods
surpass traditional methods regarding adaptability and
accuracy in fraud detection. The review presented a strong
case for system scalability to become a vital factor in
achieving fraud detection success in real-world scenarios.
Several researches have demonstrated success with hybrid
frameworks that unite traditional methods with deep
learning approaches. A Spark-integrated deep learning
system for fraud detection has been presented by Sumaya
Sanober et al. [13] while taking advantage of distributed
systems scalability. A hybrid model built on
BiLSTM-BiGRU components delivered exceptional recall
and precision to detect anomalies in financial transactions
according to Hassan Najadat et al. [14].
Ensemble and sequential models have gained attention as
fraud detection techniques in the current period. The deep
learning ensemble approach proposed by Mienye et al. [15]
uses SMOTE-ENN data resampling techniques to deal with
fraud datasets that are highly class imbalanced. Similarly,
Forough et al. [16] developed an ensemble of deep
sequential models with a voting mechanism to improve
accuracy and reduce false positives. Representation learning
techniques have shown effectiveness for detecting fraud. A
deep representation learning framework presented by
Zhenchuan Li utilized a full center loss function which
increased feature separability while reducing false positive
detection rates [17]. This approach delivered excellent
performance for spotting fraudulent behavior from
non-fraudulent actions within datasets with large class
imbalances.
Several innovative frameworks which use unsupervised
learning methods such as Marta Catillo et al. [18] proposed
AutoLog, an autoencoder-based model designed for
anomaly detection in system logs, which shares similarities
with detecting anomalies in transaction data.Overall, these
studies emphasize the evolution of fraud detection
methodologies, from traditional machine learning models to
deep learning and hybrid frameworks. While traditional
methods like Isolation Forest remain computationally
efficient, modern approaches such as deep autoencoders,
ensemble models, and representation learning provide
superior performance, particularly in handling complex and
imbalanced datasets.
**III. METHODOLOGY**
3.1 Dataset Description and Source
The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection
Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 284,806 credit
card transactions where features were generated through
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for privacy protection.
Only 492 transactions (0.17%) are labeled as
fraudulent(Class = 0) which makes the dataset highly
imbalanced. The remaining 284,314 transactions are labeled
as non-fraudulent (Class = 0). A remarkable imbalance
between non-fraudulent and fraudulent transactions helps to
understand the actual financial world situation where
fraudulent activities make up a minimal percentage of
transactions. The dataset features are-
● Time: The seconds elapsed between the transaction
and the first transaction in the dataset.
● V1 to V28: These are 28 numerical features derived
from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
ensure privacy. The actual meaning of these
features is not provided due to confidentiality.
● Amount: The transaction amount. This can be
useful for identifying high-value frauds or
understanding transaction patterns.
● Class: The target variable indicating whether a
transaction is fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).
The first 30 columns consisting of Time, V1 to V28, and
Amount contain numerical data types that are stored as
float64. The one and only categorical feature in the dataset
is stored as int in the Class column. The derived features
(V1 to V28) through PCA provide privacy protections by
stripping confidential information yet keeping vital patterns
necessary for anomaly detection. Transaction timing
information in the Time field enables fraud cluster detection
while the Amount field shows values that indicate potential
fraud. The 28 PCA-transformed components named V1 to
V28 successfully capture key variances without revealing
any personal information about cardholders or merchants.
3.2.2 Feature Selection
The research dataset consists of 30 features named V1 to
V28 together with Time and Amount columns. All these
features remain unidentified since they lack proper names or
clear meanings. The mathematical processes represent
patterns within original transaction data but remain elusive
in their exact composition. Multiple feature analysis in
datasets sometimes produces a situation known as the “curse
of dimensionality”. The data processing becomes harder
while the model performance suffers from handling
particular features when the number of features we introduce
grows significantly. A solution for this issue required us to
implement a method known as Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). PCA functions as an algorithm that enables
feature reduction by maintaining maximum available data
information. The system determines new 'principal
components' that consist of combined original features as
part of its operation. According to the amount of data
variance the new components are arranged in specific order.
The first captured component explains the maximum
variance while the second component shows the second
largest amount of variance in the sequence. The correlation
heatmap shows the relationships between the anonymized
features V1 to V28 and Time and Amount.


Figure 1. Correlation Heatmap of Features
3.2.3 Feature Extraction
PCA reduced the initial collection of 32 dimensions
consisting of 30 features together with Time and Amount
which was transformed into a new set of just 15 instances.
The conversion from 32 dimensions to 15 dimensions still
allows us to achieve 95% data retention of crucial
information. The simplification of input data through this
step proved useful due to its two-fold benefits first in
reducing the information complexity and second in lowering
computational requirements for pattern detection within time
series streams.
3.3 Training and Testing Strategy
Training and testing the model effectively is crucial for
ensuring its robustness in detecting fraudulent transactions
in real-world financial systems. The following subsections
outline the data splitting strategy, training methodology,
model evaluation, and threshold selection process applied in
this study.
3.3.1 Data Splitting
The dataset was divided into two subsets to facilitate
model training and evaluation:
● Training Set (80%): Used to train the models to
learn the underlying patterns in the data.
● Testing Set (20%): Used to evaluate how well the
trained models generalize to unseen transactions.
Since only 0.17% of the total transactions were
fraudulent, stratified sampling was employed during data
splitting. This ensured that both the training and testing sets
contained a proportional representation of normal and
fraudulent transactions.
3.3.2 Training the Model
The models were trained using different strategies based
on their learning mechanisms.
a) Autoencoder
The autoencoder is an unsupervised model that learns to
reconstruct normal transactions, making it well-suited for
anomaly detection.
Training Strategy:
● Only normal transactions (Class = 0) from the
training dataset were used.
● Fraudulent transactions were excluded from
training since they are considered anomalies during
detection.
● The model learned the hidden patterns in normal
transactions, allowing it to reconstruct them with
minimal error.
● Fraudulent transactions, being inherently different
from normal transactions, would exhibit higher
reconstruction errors, making them easier to flag as
anomalies.
b) Isolation Forest & One-Class SVM
Unlike autoencoders, Isolation Forest and One-Class
SVM use anomaly detection principles based on statistical
deviations and clustering. These models were trained on
both normal and fraudulent transactions and optimized with
hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
3.3.3 Testing the Model
Once trained, the models were evaluated using the full
testing set, which included both normal and fraudulent
transactions.
Autoencoder Testing:
● Each transaction was passed through the
autoencoder.
● A reconstruction error was computed for each
transaction.
● Transactions with high reconstruction errors were
flagged as anomalies (potential fraud).
● Isolation Forest & One-Class SVM Testing:
● These models classified transactions based on
learned decision boundaries.
● They assigned a fraud probability score to each
transaction, determining whether it should be
considered an anomaly.
3.3.4 Threshold Selection
A threshold value was established to distinguish normal
transactions from fraudulent ones. The 95th percentile of
reconstruction errors for normal transactions was used as the
threshold. This means that 95% of normal transactions had
reconstruction errors below this value, while any transaction
exceeding this error threshold was classified as fraudulent.
This threshold ensured a balance between sensitivity (recall)
and specificity (precision) in fraud detection.
The Autoencoder Model Workflow illustrated in Figure 2
presents the step-by-step process, from input encoding to
anomaly detection through reconstruction error analysis.
Figure 2. Autoencoder Model Workflow
3.4 Parameters of Each Model
Each model was optimized with carefully selected
hyperparameters to enhance anomaly detection performance.


The details of each model's configuration are outlined
below.
3.4.1 Autoencoder
The autoencoder was designed with a multi-layer
architecture to learn and reconstruct normal transaction
patterns effectively.
● Input Layer: 15 neurons corresponding to
PCA-reduced features.
● Encoder Layers: First hidden layer with 16 neurons
using ReLU activation.
● Bottleneck layer with 8 neurons, representing a
compressed latent space.
● Decoder Layers:
● A mirrored structure with 16 neurons (ReLU
activation).
● Output layer with 15 neurons using Sigmoid
activation for reconstruction.
● Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) to
minimize reconstruction errors.
● Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient learning.
● Epochs: Trained for 50 epochs to achieve stable
reconstruction ability.
● Batch Size: A batch size of 256 was used to ensure
effective training without excessive memory
consumption.
3.4.2 Isolation Forest
The Isolation Forest model was optimized to detect
anomalies by isolating fraudulent transactions using
tree-based partitioning. The contamination rate Set to 0.01,
assuming that 1% of the dataset contains anomalies. This
setting helps the model to efficiently distinguish fraudulent
transactions from normal ones.
3.4.3 One-Class SVM
One-Class SVM was configured to create a boundary
around normal transactions and detect deviations as
anomalies.
● Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to
capture non-linear relationships in the data.
● Nu Parameter: Set to 0.01, defining the upper limit
for the proportion of transactions classified as
anomalies.
● Gamma Parameter: Set to 0.1, controlling the
influence of individual data points on the decision
boundary.
These hyperparameters were chosen based on
experimental tuning to ensure optimal performance across
all models while balancing accuracy, recall, and
computational efficiency.
3.5 Summary of Model Design
The table provides a comparative overview of the models
employed in this research, highlighting their training data
utilization, anomaly detection methods, computational
efficiency, and ideal application scenarios. The
Autoencoder, leveraging only normal transactions, excels at
capturing complex patterns through reconstruction error
analysis. In contrast, the Isolation Forest, using random
partitioning of both normal and fraudulent data, offers the
fastest computational efficiency, making it suitable for
large-scale, real-time detection. The One-Class SVM utilizes
decision boundaries to detect anomalies, but its lower
computational efficiency limits its scalability, making it
more appropriate for datasets requiring intricate
boundary-based analysis.

The methodology adopts a structured method for
detecting credit card anomalies which combines deep
learning models with traditional machine learning
approaches. According to the Autoencoder implementation,
deep learning-based reconstruction anomaly detection
allows it to decode normal transaction patterns in order to
detect irregularities potentially stemming from fraud.
Traditional machine learning benchmarks include both
Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM which use statistical
and boundary-based methods for anomaly classification. A
complete evaluation process includes using accuracy,
precision, recall and computational efficiency metrics to
assess the effectiveness of these models. After presenting
experimental findings the paper shows a comparative
analysis of models through a review of their strengths while
identifying their limitations for real-world use in fraud
detection systems.

Autoencoder had the best results with ROC AUC of 0.
evidencing its potential as an approach to effectively
distinguish between normal and fraudulent transactions. It
also attained a high recall of.86 that means most of the
fraudulent transactions were correctly captured although its
precision was low with a score of .03 meaning many false
positives. However, Isolation Forest gave the worst results
with ROC AUC of 0.05 proving that it is not capable of
distinguishing fraudulent transactions. It registered a low
accuracy of 0.11; therefore, it misdiagnosed many fraud
cases, and it had an average recall of 0.66. One-Class SVM
had slightly different results with ROC AUC = 0.06 and thus
showing that it was not as helpful as the autoencoder.
Although its recall was high (0.87) similar to that of the
autoencoder, it had low precision (0.06) which means that
many of the results were false positives. Overall, while the
autoencoder excelled in distinguishing fraud, all models
struggled with precision, highlighting the trade-off between
catching fraudulent transactions and avoiding false
positives.

**V. CONCLUSION**
In this research the utmost focuses were on three types of
classification algorithms, including Autoencoder, Isolation
Forest, and One-Class SVM for credit card fraud detection
on a credit card dataset. Out of all the algorithms used the
Autoencoder received the highest ROC AUC value of 0.
and the highest recall level of 86%, proving the model to be
effective in detecting fraudulent transactions. While
Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM had a smaller training
time needed than the others, the results for fraud detection
were considerably worse, with significantly lower ROC
AUC scores. Autoencoder is remarkable because it can learn
and recognize patterns in normal transactions to spot fraud,
which makes the financial system ideal for using
Autoencoders. Future work could explore hybrid models
combining deep learning and classical approaches to further
improve performance.
